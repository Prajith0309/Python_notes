So inheritance can be used to inherit different properties and methods of a superclass to a sub class and 
polymorphism can be used to rewrite specific methods of the sub class based on the needs

''' 
Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit the properties and methods of its superclass, 
effectively creating a new class with the combined features of both. 
This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy, as the shared functionality doesn't need to be duplicated.

Polymorphism, on the other hand, enables the subclass to redefine specific methods of the superclass, 
tailoring them to its specific requirements. This flexibility allows the subclass to adapt its behavior 
based on its unique characteristics or the context in which it is used.

In essence, inheritance establishes a general structure and provides a foundation for subclasses, 
while polymorphism grants subclasses the autonomy to customize their behavior as needed. 
This combination of inheritance and polymorphism creates a powerful and versatile mechanism for designing object-oriented programs.
