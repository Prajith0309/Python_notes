Variables are named storage locations in memory that hold values. 
They allow you to represent data and refer to it throughout your program.

2. Expressions:
Expressions are combinations of variables, operators, and values that evaluate to a single value. 
They represent computations and transformations of data.

Types of Expressions:

Arithmetic expressions: 
Perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Evaluate relationships between values using operators like ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.

Boolean expressions: 
Combine Boolean values (True or False) using logical operators like and, or, and not.

3. Statements:

Types of Statements:

Assignment statements: Bind values to variables.

Print statements: Display output to the console.

Input statements: Retrieve input from the user.

Control flow statements: Modify the program's execution flow based on conditions or loops.
